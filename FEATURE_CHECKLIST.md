# Feature Development Checklist

Complete checklist for adding new features to MCP Sentinel with automated documentation.

## Before You Start

- [ ] Read [DOCUMENTATION_AUTOMATION.md](DOCUMENTATION_AUTOMATION.md)
- [ ] Understand the feature requirements
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Documentation Setup (Day 1)

### 1.1 Generate Documentation Template

```bash
# For detector
./scripts/docs/generate-doc.sh --type detector --name "xss-detection"

# For feature
./scripts/docs/generate-doc.sh --type feature --name "real-time-monitoring"
```

**Result:** Documentation template created with placeholders.

### 1.2 Fill In Specification

Edit the generated documentation file:

- [ ] Overview section - What does it do?
- [ ] Use cases - Why is it needed?
- [ ] Examples - How will it be used?
- [ ] Configuration - What options will it have?

### 1.3 Review with Team

- [ ] Present specification to team
- [ ] Get feedback on approach
- [ ] Confirm interface/API design
- [ ] Update documentation based on feedback

---

## Phase 2: Implementation (Days 2-4)

### 2.1 Implement Core Functionality

- [ ] Create source files (e.g., `src/detectors/xss.rs`)
- [ ] Implement core logic
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Add logging

**Note:** Write documentation ALONGSIDE code, not after!

### 2.2 Document As You Code

While implementing, fill in documentation:

- [ ] Add real code examples (from your manual testing)
- [ ] Document configuration options (as you add them)
- [ ] Note troubleshooting issues (as you encounter bugs)
- [ ] Add performance notes (from your observations)

### 2.3 Create Examples

- [ ] Add vulnerable code samples to `examples/[feature]/vulnerable.*`
- [ ] Add fixed code samples to `examples/[feature]/fixed.*`
- [ ] Test examples work correctly
- [ ] Add example README

### 2.4 Write Tests

- [ ] Unit tests (`tests/[type]/[name]_test.rs`)
  - [ ] Basic functionality
  - [ ] Edge cases
  - [ ] Error handling
  - [ ] False positives
- [ ] Integration tests
  - [ ] End-to-end scenarios
  - [ ] CLI integration
  - [ ] Output format validation

### 2.5 Validate Continuously

After each coding session:

```bash
# Validate your documentation
./scripts/docs/validate-docs.sh --feature "Your Feature Name"

# Run tests
cargo test [feature_name]

# Manual testing
mcp-sentinel scan examples/[feature]/vulnerable.*
```

---

## Phase 3: Complete Documentation (Day 5)

- [ ] Document recommended usage patterns
- [ ] Add anti-patterns to avoid

**README.md:**

- [ ] Update detector count (if detector)

**CHANGELOG.md:**
- [ ] Add entry for upcoming version
- [ ] List new features/changes
- [ ] Note any breaking changes
- [ ] Mention migration steps (if needed)

### 3.3 Validate Everything

```bash
# Run full documentation validation
./scripts/docs/validate-docs.sh --all

# Check for broken links
./scripts/docs/check-links.sh

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Build to ensure no compile errors
cargo build --release
```

---

## Phase 4: Review (Day 6)

### 4.1 Self-Review

- [ ] Run the feature following your own documentation
- [ ] Try all examples - do they work?
- [ ] Read documentation as if you're a new user
- [ ] Check for typos and grammar
- [ ] Ensure language is clear and concise
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting

### 4.2 Peer Review

**Code Review:**
- [ ] Assign reviewer for code changes
- [ ] Address code review feedback
- [ ] Update code and tests as needed

**Documentation Review:**
- [ ] Assign reviewer for documentation
- [ ] Address documentation feedback
- [ ] Fix any unclear sections
- [ ] Add missing information

**User Testing** (if possible):
- [ ] Have someone follow your guide
- [ ] Note any confusion or issues
- [ ] Update documentation to clarify

### 4.3 CI/CD Validation

```bash
# Run CI checks locally
./.github/workflows/test-locally.sh

# Or push to PR and wait for CI
git push origin feature/my-feature
# CI will run automatically
```

**CI checks that must pass:**
- [ ] Documentation validation
- [ ] No broken links
- [ ] Code examples compile
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Changelog updated

## Tips for Success

### Do's ‚úÖ

1. **Write docs alongside code** - Don't leave it for later
2. **Test your examples** - Make sure they actually work
3. **Keep it simple** - Clear language, short sentences
4. **Add visuals** - Code examples, command outputs, diagrams
5. **Think like a user** - What would confuse you?
6. **Validate often** - Catch issues early
7. **Ask for review** - Fresh eyes catch mistakes

### Don'ts ‚ùå

1. **Don't skip documentation** - It's not optional
2. **Don't use jargon** - Explain technical terms
3. **Don't leave TODOs** - Finish sections completely
4. **Don't copy-paste** - Customize examples for your feature
5. **Don't skip validation** - Run checks before submitting
6. **Don't merge without approval** - Wait for reviews
7. **Don't forget CHANGELOG** - Users need to know what changed
